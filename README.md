# Wilderness-Weather-Station
Using Python, HTML, JavaScript, and Java; our orginization created 3 different systems: 

1) A weather station system that collects data from multiple wilderness weather stations.

2) A data management system which allows for the display & storage of past & current data and carries out data processing and analysis for use in the maintenence system. 

3) A station maintenence system, which displays warnings from the data system and monitors for health. In addition to this, the instruments will be monitored to see hardware faults, the system power will be gauged, and will be shut down if the weather is potentially damaging.
