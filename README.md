# Wilderness-Weather-Station
Using Python and Java, create 3 different systems: a weather station system that collect data from wilderness weather stations, a data management and archiving system, that stores the data, carries out data processing and analysis and stores it, and a station maintenence system, that takes the data from the weather station system and monitors for health.

In addition to this, the instruments will be monitored to see hardware faults, and the system power will be gauged, and will be shut down if the weather is potentially damaging.
