# Wilderness-Weather-Station
•The government of a country with large areas of wilderness decides to deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas. 
•Weather stations collect data from a set of instruments that measure temperature and pressure, sunshine, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.
•The weather station includes a number of instruments that measure weather parameters such as the wind speed and direction, the ground and air temperatures, the barometric pressure and the rainfall over a 24-hour period. 
Each of these instruments is controlled by a software system that takes parameter readings periodically and manages the data collected from the instrument.

Using Python and Java, collect the data from the wilderness weather stations, store it, and compare it for accuracy.
