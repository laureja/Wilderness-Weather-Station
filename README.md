# Wilderness-Weather-Station
•The government of a country with large areas of wilderness decides to deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas. 
•Weather stations collect data from a set of instruments that measure temperature and pressure, sunshine, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.
•The weather station includes a number of instruments that measure weather parameters such as the wind speed and direction, the ground and air temperatures, the barometric pressure and the rainfall over a 24-hour period. 
Each of these instruments is controlled by a software system that takes parameter readings periodically and manages the data collected from the instrument.

Using Python and Java, create 3 different systems: a weather station system that collect data from wilderness weather stations, a data management and archiving system, that stores the data, carries out data processing and analysis and stores it, and a station maintenence system, that takes the data from the weather station system and monitors for health.

In addition to this, the instruments will be monitored to see hardware faults, and the system power will be gauged, and will be shut down if the weather is potentially damaging.
